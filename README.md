### Projects

#### Python Personality Test Project
This Python project is an interactive personality test built using conditional logic, loops, and score tracking. Created through JDoodle, it helps users discover their personality type based on their quiz responses and score system!!

![PythonFinishedCode](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/edd41c26-3b93-4ce5-a3c7-d170cb1ffbfc)
- Initial Project Idea:
The inspiration for the concept of this project came from a need to display our creative coding skills in Python by working to create an interactive personality quiz. The challenge involved creating a 10-question quiz and each question having a unique point value assigned to its possible answers. Designing a personality test was inspired by the fact that it could give users a simple, fast, and enjoyable means of discovering the type of personality they might have or learning about aspects of personality not always visible. The project was a creative solution to working with Python concepts and developing something that interacts with users in a fun and interesting way.

- Tools I Used:
The major tools utilized in the implementation of the project were JDoodle, through which the Python code was executed and validated. W3Schools was also used to learn Python syntax and best practices. Course lectures and a chatbot (ChatGPT) were also used to double-check my logic and shed light on the issues with the while loops used in my code.

- Challenges I Faced:
A key problem that was faced was the task of ensuring that the total score of the quiz accurately reflected the relevant personality type, in such a manner that the scores did not produce results that were too high, not high enough, or random. A lot of experimenting with different score intervals was required to figure out the right distribution of the score intervals so that each interval represented a different personality type. Overcoming this problem helped achieve a better understanding of conditional statements and score calculations in the Python programming language.

- Other Materials:
Aside from using the internet resources like W3Schools and ChatGPT, I used the course resources to inform my project development. Although I didn't work directly with my fellow students, I used the combined examples and feedback received in the course to refine my methodological framework. 

- Result:
The major objective of the project was to create a personality evaluation program that could interactively and efficiently compute results from user input. To accomplish that objective, the project successfully developed a fully functional program that interacts with users, calculates total scores, and then presents the user's personality classification. If the chance arises to continue working on the project, I will make it more comprehensive by including more personality classifications, increasing the questionnaire's length and depth, and possibly using graphical interfaces or color-coded outcomes to enhance its applications and interactivity.

#### SPSS Cricket Chirp Analysis Project
This SPSS project provided an in-depth analysis of the relation between temperature and cricket chirping rates using descriptive statistics alongside scatterplot visualization methods. From the findings, there is a strong positive correlation that is clearly evident, showing that with rising temperatures, the rates at which crickets chirp also tend to increase noticeably.

 ![SPSSContent](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/71b8c312-9527-4771-adac-d4c15a987f1f)
 - Initial Project Idea:
This project was undertaken as part of my Computer Science module, Making Sense of Data, where we were tasked with creating visual displays using SPSS. The overall aim was to explore the relationship between temperature and the frequency of cricket chirping. The problem we sought to solve was understanding the degree to which environmental factors, like temperature, influence the behavior of animals, in this case, the frequency of cricket chirping. This kind of analysis is important in that it demonstrates how trends in data explain real-world observable phenomena.

- Tools I Used:
The major tools used to achieve this project were SPSS software, along with class lectures, teaching videos, and personal notes taken throughout the course regarding the correct use of SPSS.

- Challenges I Faced:
A major difficulty faced was understanding the right methodologies in SPSS for producing descriptive statistics that included the calculation of the mean, standard deviation, max, and min values for the temperature and chirp datasets. The task of analyzing statistical measures and determining significant correlations by using the visual display offered by the scatterplot presented a big hurdle, one that I overcame through repetitive practice and extensive review of course materials.

- Other Resources:
Besides the material used in the course, I used no external resources and no direct collaboration with others for the project. I used SPSS tutorials and support documentation on the web to further understand the software capabilities.

- Result:
The main goal of this research was to illustrate the strong relationship between ambient temperature and the frequency of cricket chirps using accurate data visualization and statistical analysis. This was successfully achieved by creating a scatterplot that showed a clear positive relationship, also supported by descriptive statistics. If the project were to be extended, I would explore additional variables like diurnal cycles or humidity levels to determine if they have any impacts on chirping frequencies, and could also include trendline equations or predictive models to enable a broader analysis.

#### Microsoft Access Retail Database Project
In this project, I used Microsoft Access as a tool to carefully create an extensive retail dataset and then develop a set of meaningful queries. Through this experience, my comprehension of key concepts pertaining to the management of databases, the complex process of creating queries, and the numerous ways in which one can successfully extract useful business information from available data greatly improved.

 ![MSAccessContent](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0d663842-10a5-4202-9181-23fb7c2eb55d)
 - Initial Project Idea:
My goal was to utilize Microsoft Access and learn database management and design. My objective was to create my own data set and create significant queries that could uncover interesting interactions between customers and products in a retail shop. I sought to solve the problem of understanding the best ways to handle data and apply queries to answer such relevant business queries like costly products, newest products, or most reordered products.

- Tools I Used:
My major resources were classroom lectures and videos, and also an AI assistant named ChatGPT who helped in debugging and the rectification of the errors that I encountered in writing and in implementing my queries.

- Challenges I Faced:
One of the difficulties I experienced was actually attempting to discern how to ask helpful questions that not only functioned but also displayed the data appropriately and in its entirety to its best potential. Learning how to develop appropriate criteria and properly join tables was a learning experience, but one that I was able to navigate by doing and also through instruction in course material.

- Other Resources:
Aside from the class textbook and the AI assistant, I did not have any direct work with classmates. I did utilize Microsoft Access help files and tutorial sites' samples to learn more about query construction. 

- Result:
The goal of the project was to efficiently create and maintain my own dataset and create useful queries such as ItemsOver50Bucks, ItemsAddedAfterFeb2025, and HighestReorderLevel. I achieved it and appreciated the ability of databases to extract useful knowledge. If I were to extend it, I would add item and customer purchase connections to better observe sales patterns, reordering patterns, or customer interests.
